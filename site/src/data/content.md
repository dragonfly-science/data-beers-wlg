DataBeers is a community-driven,
[global](https://twitter.com/search?f=users&vertical=default&q=databeers)
series of meet-ups aiming at bringing together local technical
communities to talk about data science over delicious beer,
alcoholic or not.

Wellington has both great craft beer and great data science
artisans -- as well as data science artisans who love craft beer!
So this is the perfect opportunity for us all to get together,
learn new things from others and teach others the things we know!

Our first edition will take place on <b>August 19</b> at Dragonfly Data
Science <b>(Level 4, 158 Victoria St, Wellington)</b> at <b>5pm</b>. We will have time
to chat and catch up until about 5:25 pm, when our speakers will deliver
their quick presentations, in a
[PechaKucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha) format.
